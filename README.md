# rust_ray_tracing_oneweekend
Ray tracing using rust following the guide ray tracing in one weekend

Highly amateur ray tracing app I made for learning rust concepts

current features:
- implemented parallel computing with threads using rayon

work in progress:
- show the images in realtime using rust druid 

planned features:
- compute using cuda for realtime rendering (couldn't get arrayfire to work, rust-cuda seemed too complicated)
